Sunshine
========

This is only for learning purpose. I am uploading some of the files from Udacity course.

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

For the original version, please go [here](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine).

A changelog for the course can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/document/d/193xJb_OpcNCqgquMhxPrMh05IEYFXQqt0S6-6YK8gBw/pub).
